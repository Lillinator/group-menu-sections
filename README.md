# Discourse goup-menu-sections
This theme component allows displaying Discourse navigation menu sections to only specific user groups.  Group visibility must be set to "Everyone" in group interaction settings.  User lowercase slugs for section names fields (ie: "superuser-menu-section" and case-sensitive group names in the group fields (ie: "SuperUsers, staff").
